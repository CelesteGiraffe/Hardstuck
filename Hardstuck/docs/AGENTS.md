# Documentation AGENTS guidelines

Applies to files under `/workspace/Hardstuck/Hardstuck/docs`.

- Keep docs concise and task-focused for plugin contributors.
- Avoid duplicating details from the README; link to it when possible.
- Prefer Markdown headings and bullet lists for quick scanning.
- When describing build steps, align with the MSVC v143 toolset requirement and `Release|x64` defaults.
- Document intent and assumptions; do not speculate about unimplemented features.
